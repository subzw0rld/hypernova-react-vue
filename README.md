# A Micro FrontEnd POC using ARA and Hypernova
This POC involves hosting 2 applications, one in React and the other in Vue within the same page and also have them communicate with each other.

This POC was take from the following git repo --> https://github.com/marconi1992/hypernova-micro-frontends

# Setup

- If using mac or linux then execute the setup file using the following command.

```
sh setup.sh
```

The command above will install all the dependencies required by the 3 projects used for this POC (aggregrator, react, vue). This saves time needed in manually installing dependencies inside all the project folders.

- cd hypernova-aggregator
- yarn buildAll
- yarn startAll

The application would launch itself on http://localhost:8080

Happy Coding :wink:
